This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript's error handling.  The `bug.vbs` file shows a function that fails to handle an empty parameter gracefully, resulting in a runtime error.  The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.  This example highlights the importance of robust parameter validation and proper error handling in VBScript to ensure application stability.
